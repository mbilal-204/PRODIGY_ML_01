Task-01 - Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms
This repository contains a comprehensive Python script for predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. It includes:

Data preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categorical features.
Feature engineering to create new relevant features like total bathroom area and total outdoor area.
Model training using multiple regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and CatBoost Regressor.
Evaluation of models using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and visualization of predictions against actual prices.
